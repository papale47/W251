There were only two MQTT topics.  The first was "streaming" and this represented the faces coming from the face detector container and going to the broker (on the NX).  The forwarder container subscribed to this topic and republished the messages using the MQTT topic of "streaming2" to the broker in the AWS cloud.  There wasn't much additional thought given to the names of the topics themselves.  I just wanted to give them differnet names to distinguish between the topics in the forwarder.py program.

I chose QOS level 0 when publishing all messages.  I chose this because we are streaming a fairly large volume of data in real time, and I did not want to cause additional latency by requiring additional rig around ensuring the message was received once and only once.  This is especially true since most of the images are very similar, and it would be acceptable if not all made it through.
