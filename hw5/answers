What is TensorFlow? Which company is the leading contributor to TensorFlow?
-TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
-TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use.

What is TensorRT? How is it different from TensorFlow?
-NVIDIA TensorRT is an SDK for high-performance deep learning inference. It includes a deep learning inference optimizer and runtime that delivers low latency and high-throughput for deep learning inference applications.
-TensorFlow remains the most popular deep learning framework today while NVIDIA TensorRT speeds up deep learning inference through optimizations and high-performance runtimes for GPU-based platforms.

What is ImageNet? How many images does it contain? How many classes?
-ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.
-More than 14 million images have been hand-annotated by the project to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided
-The ILSVRC uses a "trimmed" list of only 1000 image categories or "classes", including 90 of the 120 dog breeds classified by the full ImageNet schema.

Please research and explain the differences between MobileNet and GoogleNet (Inception) architectures.
-MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks.
-GoogLeNet or Inception v1 is basically a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is 27 layers deep.  There is a layer called inception layer which allows internal sublayers to pick and choose which filter size will be relevant to learn the required information.
